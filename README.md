Solution of test task for huge it company

3. Performance of hash collections:
Python provides not bad implementation of hash collection, it is well known as Dictionary. Know it? Let's confirm this statement! Nice to have some test harness which would take several (two or more) hash implementations like default one or Google hash or your own, perform some standard performance test set (sequential insert, random insert, lookup, delete operation, may be memory consumption) and make some conclusion which one is the best. Performance is a goal, correctness is a constraint! Agree?
